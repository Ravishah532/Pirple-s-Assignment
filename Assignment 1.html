    <ol>
      <li>Slice the pear lengthways as finely as you can.</li>
      <li>
        Toss gently with the salad leaves, a little drizzle each of extra virgin
        olive oil and red wine vinegar, and a pinch of black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scrunch the minced pork in your clean hands with a pinch of seasoning,
        then shape into a 1cm-thick patty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rub with 1 teaspoon of olive oil, then place in a large non-stick frying
        pan on a high heat for 2 minutes, while you halve and toast the bun
        alongside, removing it when golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip the burger, then, after 2 minutes, crumble the blue cheese next to
        it to melt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Move the burger on top of the oozy cheese, jiggle around to coat, then
        put it on your bun base.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stack in as much pear and salad as the bun will hold, pop the lid on,
        squash and devour, with any extra salad on the side.
