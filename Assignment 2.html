    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <p>
      Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a usually round,
      flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese,
      and often various other ingredients (anchovies, olives, meat, etc.) baked
      at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza
      is sometimes called a pizzetta. In Italy, pizza served in formal settings,
      such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced and eaten with the use of a
      knife and fork. In casual settings it is cut into wedges to be eaten while
      held in the hand.

      Pizza helps your body absorb more lycopene. It's no secret that tomatoes
      contain lots of lycopene, an antioxidant compound that helps prevent heart
      disease and illnesses. But eating lycopene-packed foods that also have
      small amounts of fat, like pizza, will make your body absorb this
      antioxidant much better
